# Word Embeddings

## Idea

Word embeddings are real-valued **vectors**, with a *reduced* dimensionality such as 50, 100, or 300 dimensions.
The key idea behind those is that words with a similar meaning will be represented close to each other.
Therefore each word is mapped to one vector in a predefined **vector space**.
The distribution is learned based on the usage of words.

## Improvement

* Dimensionality reduction is comparison to sparse word representations like **one-hot encoding**
  * A few hundred vs. possibly thousands
  * Huge performance increase
* Natural capturing of the meaning of words
  * Words with similar usage result in similar representations

## Concept

There are different ways to compute word embeddings:

### Traditional Word Embeddings

1. **BoW** - Bag of Words
   * One-hot encoded matrix of words or n-grams
   * Common challenge: BoW does not include context information
2. **TF-IDF** - term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency
   * Numerical statistic which reflects how important a word or n-gram is to a document
   * Value increases proportionally to mentions in the document
   * ![tf-idf](tf-idf.png) - https://skymind.ai/wiki/bagofwords-tf-idf
3. **Distributional Embeddings**
   * Encapsulate context based on mutual information with other words in the document
   * Global co-references or based on restriced windows

### Neural Embeddings

1. Embedding Layer
   * Neural network jointly learned on one-hot encoded word vectors
   * Vector-size is specified as part of the model
2. Word2Vec
   * Predictive embedding model
   * **CBOW** - Continuous bag-of-words
     * Predicting current word based on context
     * Order of words does not influence prediction!
   * **Skip Ngram** - Continuous skip-gram
     * Predicting surrounding context by given word
   * "CBOW is faster while skip-gram is slower but does a better job for infrequent words."

3. GloVe
   * Same intuition behind the co-occuring matrix used in distributional embeddings, but uses neural methods to decompose the co-occurrence matrix into more expressive and dense word vectors
4. FastText
   * Based on Word2Vec
   * Value of each representation in training are averaged into one vector
   * Encodes sub-word information

## Evaluation

When dealing with vectors, a common way to calculate a similarity score is [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).
