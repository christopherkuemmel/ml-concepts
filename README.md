# ml-core

This repository contains notes on different ml-based technologies. Please note that this is for my own educational purpose.

All the different post, should discuss the ideas in the following topics:

1. Idea - What is the main idea behind this approach?
2. Improvement - What does it make better than other approaches?
3. Concept - The concept in more details, and possibly pictures!
4. Evaluation - TBD
5. Production - How can this be applied in production and for which use-cases?
6. References - Links, Guides, Papers, etc.
7. Examples - Own implementation of the technology
